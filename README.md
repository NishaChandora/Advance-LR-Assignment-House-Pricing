# Advance Linear Regression Assignment - House Pricing
> As a part of the course curriculam, this is an attempt to demostrate the advance linear regression techniques with regularization on the House Pricing dataset provided. The objective is to provide top features on which house pricing is dependent.

## Files included
* Jupyter notebook .ipynb file demostrating the model building and evaluation
* Subjective Questions pdf for assignment questions

## General Information
- A US-based housing company, Surprise Housing plans to enter the Australian market by purchasing houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.

The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house.
How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Our objective is to build a regression model using regularisation to help the company predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether or not to invest in them.


## Conclusions
- The Regularization techniques help to build a better and robust model compare to linear regression model.
